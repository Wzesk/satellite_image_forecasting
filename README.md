# Drought Impact Forecasting - EarthNet 2021

Climate change has a large impact on our environment :earth_americas:. We notice this as all around the world, catastrophic events such as droughts occur more and more frequently. In this project, we develop various deep learning models for the EarthNet2021 challenge (https://www.earthnet.tech/), where our task is to predict future satellite images from past ones using features such as elevation maps and weather. With one of our models, a peephole convolutional LSTM, we manage to beat the current best model on the leaderboard.
